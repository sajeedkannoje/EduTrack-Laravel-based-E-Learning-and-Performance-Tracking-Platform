<h3>Pro Tip  </h3>
<p>
    Go through the entire module on your own, doing all of the quizzes and reading through all of the material before you teach it.  (Some, or all, of this material will probably be new and useful to you.)  Do a little research if necessary.  This should help you anticipate questions the particular group of students in your class will have.  Remember, though, it’s okay for you to learn along with them.   
</p>

<h3>Timeline </h3>
<p>

    The entire module should take more than one day, but less than a week, depending on a number of factors unique to your situation and class.  Once you go through all of the material, you’ll have a better idea of the pacing and a specific timeline.  
</p>
<h3>Aims/Objectives</h3>
    <p>
        1) Students will be introduced to the world of personal finance <br>
        2) Students will confront the power of compound interest <br>
        3) Students will consider the central roles of saving and budgeting in personal finance  <br>
        4) In several sections, students will use critical thinking to ponder advanced personal finance concepts such as net worth, retirement, economics, and the role of money <br>
        5) Students will understand the future importance of credit, banking, and credit cards in their lives

<h3>Background/Prerequisite Knowledge	</h3>

<p>
While all material is designed for learners with little or no understanding of the topics presented it’s probably not appropriate or useful for young people less than 16 years old.  Ideal candidates are high school seniors nearing graduation who will soon be confronting many of these topics or any adult who is ready to learn. 
</p>

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>
<p>
0. Do Now/Anticipatory Set:  Present students with a question related to the module material.  This way, as they enter the room, they have a related topic to discuss with others or think about silently. 
Example:  What does personal finance mean to you?<br>
1. Watch the introductory video together as a class (if possible). <br>
2. Students can work through the module on their own.  To move from one section to the next students must correctly answer all questions in each mini-quiz.  <br>
3. The final test in each module will be graded (though students don’t have to get every answer correct on this test).<br>
4. Wrap Up: The Checklist at the end of each module can be used for a wrap-up of the module topics.  This activity might prompt some lingering questions that students have. <br>
*Consider breaking up the individual work with some of the extension activities. <p>

<h3>Necessary Resources and Materials:</h3>

<p>
    Computer/tablet/Chromebook/laptop with internet access and a web browser.
    *This website was not designed with a smartphone screen in mind
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>
    1. Observe and monitor student participation, effort, and understanding.<br>
    2. Each section of the module has a mini-quiz where students can make multiple attempts until they correctly answer every question.  <br>
    3. There is a final exam covering the key points in each section of the module.  It will be graded by the software.
</p>

<h3>Extension Activities</h3>
<p>
    *While the design of the lessons lets an individual go through them on their own it’s nice to mix things up with some whole class activities. 
</p>

<p>

    Do a guided practice taking students back through what they’ve just learned, letting them add their own input as they gain confidence with the new information.
</p>

<p>

    There is a lot of room for classroom discussion here.  It should be easy to get students to share on topics like saving money, the role of money and credit, the power of compound interest, cash vs. credit, getting into the saving habit, etc.  For example, ask how they could get started on their financial future right now?  (They could develop savings habits, work a part-time job and save some of the money, discuss saving with their parents, learn about how to invest saved money when they adults, etc.)
</p>
<p>

    Give students a list of income amounts and sources, essential expenses, and nonessential expenses for one month.  Have them design a budget (using the one in this module as a template) and determine how much money is left over to be saved.  There are now all kinds of questions and alterations you can make to raise new questions.  Which nonessential expense should you drop/keep?  What happens if you make more/less income?  There is a lot of material for discussion here, as well.  
</p>

<p>

    Find an online compound interest calculator that you like and design a worksheet or series of questions for students to answer using that particular calculator.  For example, use the Moneychimp compound interest calculator to find the future value starting with a principal of $5,000, adding $5,000 a year, with 20 years to grow, at an interest rate of 8% compounded once per year.  What happens if you increase the interest rate to 10% a year? 
</p>

<p>

    Design a net worth exercise or worksheet.  Give students a list of things they own (assets) and amounts they owe (liabilities) to determine this person’s net worth.  There are all kinds of directions you can go from here.  Add new amounts.  Create a negative net worth situation and ask what that means.  What thing(s) would need to happen to make this individual’s net worth equal zero?  What would that mean?  Discuss what net worth means and why it’s worth knowing.  Tie net worth to retirement.
</p>
<p>
    Students could write an essay on how this module can help them improve the quality of their life and be a better adult.  They should include a section on things they disagree with.  
</p>

<h3>
    Backup/No Internet/Emergency Activities
</h3>
<p>    

    Have students write about any topic they know well and design a five-question mini quiz.  They should write for someone who knows nothing about this topic.  Give writing and quiz design tips.  The text should be divided up into small chunks and the questions should refer to the most important information and key points.  <br>

    *A topic relevant to this module would be “What is the role of money in your life right now?  How is it essential?” <br>


    If there’s time have them hand in the paper with the writing and quiz.  Pass them back out and let each student read a different paper and do the quiz.  Then call on students to discuss the new topic they just learned about.  
</p>

<p>

    The budget and net worth exercises from above can be used to design worksheets that students can do individually or in small groups.  
</p>
<p>
    Have students write a paper explaining everything they know about personal finance to someone who knows nothing about these topics.  They could also follow the paragraphs of explanation with a quiz of eight questions.  When the writing is completed students can group up and share and quiz each other, or do the same for the whole class.

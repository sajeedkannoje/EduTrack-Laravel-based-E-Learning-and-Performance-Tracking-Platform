<h3>Guide</h3>
<p>What most of us need is some kind of an easy-to-use tool to help transition to a (more) plant-based diet.  The <i>Exsalus Food Continuum</i> is the perfect guide.  Whole foods like fruits and vegetables get the highest grade of A+ while deep-fried things like French fries and chicken nuggets receive the lowest grade of F.  All of the foods to the right of the dark line (between B- and A-), in the green zone, are the most natural and least processed.  They are your best source for nutrients and the best, most healthy dietary approach for both you and the planet.      
[With a continuum the entries next to each other are somewhat similar but the extremes on each end of the continuum, fried animal products and whole plant foods (in this case), are very different.]</p>

<p>There are a few interesting things to notice.  Processed plant-based foods like (frozen) veggie burgers and protein bars get lower grades than whole plant foods because of the processing.  Fried animal products receive an even lower grade than other animal products.  Oils and sweeteners receive the same grade as soda.  Potato chips and ice cream receive a (slightly higher) C- grade because they include (highly-processed) fruits or vegetables.  Junk food is ranked ahead of animal products.  Finally, foods with lower grades deliver more calories (and, of course, little or no nutrients).    </p>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>Now over the course of a meal, or a day, you may have some foods from the C column, some from the D column, and a lot from the A+ column to give you an average of A-.  The Exsalus Food Continuum can help you gauge how you did for a dish, a meal, a day or, really, for any amount of time.  It’s also easy to see that someone sticking to the most strict version of the ideal diet presented earlier would only eat foods from the three green zone columns. </p>

<p>Last night I used the <span style="background-color:#feef00">Instant Pot</span> to make chili that had eight A+ ingredients, four A ingredients, one B ingredient, and one C ingredient.  So, it’s fair to give that dish a grade somewhere between A- and A+.  While pizza is listed as an F food, you could easily bake your own pizza with a much higher grade.  Let’s say you made your own crust and red sauce, then loaded up the pie with vegetables and just a small amount of cheese.  Since cheese is a dairy product the amount of cheese would determine how far out of the plant-based green zone (A+, A, A-) your grade would be.  You could easily make a B+ pie!   
[Essentially a high quality, fancy pressure cooker with a variety of other uses.]</p>

<p>The same argument could be made for a burger.  Using Impossible Burger and a whole wheat roll you could easily make an A- burger.  Your choice of condiments and cheese could, however, pull it down to a B+.  The burgers and pizza in the F column would be the convenience takeout fast food versions.  In contrast to homemade food, they are highly-processed and loaded with fat, sugar, salt, oil, and animal products.  Think about how you could raise the grade of a taco or burrito.  </p>

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Most Americans will (at least initially) have trouble sticking to the A- and above foods.  That's okay because now you have a tool to easily assess your diet and how you’re doing.  It’s important not to attach shame or guilt to your eating.  Use a dish, meal, or day with a low grade as information.  Look at the components and their grades and consider how you could bring that grade up.     </p>

<p>While it wasn’t my initial intention, the Exsalus Food Continuum reinforces the argument against not only processed, but also convenience foods.  Foods that are the closest to their most natural, unprocessed state are the best source of nutrients.  Calories aren’t listed in the Continuum because you are allowed to eat almost unlimited amounts of foods in the three green columns.  More on that later.     </p>
